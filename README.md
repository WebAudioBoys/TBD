# TBD
The TBD sequencer is a first prototype for a fun, no-setup web collaboration tool. Vist www.tbd.zone for the current release of our music maker!

This version was a final project for Digital Audio Processing II in the NYU Music Technology Master's program. 
A collaboration by Tyler, Brad, and Dave.

## Overview
TBD is a collaborative sequencer that connects music makers sharing a local wireless network. Users realize the music written in the TBD's editor using their favorite desktop or web DAW. The TBD connects to DAWs via virtual ports - so any platform or software you prefer is fine!

This application is a prototype for a more advanced version now in development at www.tbd.zone.
